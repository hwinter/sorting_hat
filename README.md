This program works with 1 simple input of a file with names you want sorted. It also makes assumptions about the file, so ask Jakub Prchlik or Kathy Reeves at SAO for the 2017 version if all else fails.
Otherwise run the program by "python assign_review.py -f <i>filename</i>". The program outputs to matched_people_advisors.txt and matched_people_students.txt. The matched student output is mostly for code verification.
